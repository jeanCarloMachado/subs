 - %1,%2,%n - a positional argument, meaning that all occurrences of %1 will be replaced by the first argument
 - %i - a indentation unit, uses the same as the top-level indentation


## Program options

-h      to get the program help
-p      to set the preferred section, useful to get only say, python snippets instead of php
